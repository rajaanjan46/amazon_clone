# Amazon Clone (React, no Vite)

This is a small starter Amazon-like frontend built with React (Create React App style). It includes product listing, product page, and a simple cart persisted to localStorage.

How to run (Windows cmd.exe):

```cmd
cd /d d:\front-end_project
npm install
npm start
```

Notes:
- This project is intentionally minimal. Next steps: add authentication, backend API, payments, better styling, tests, and deployment.
